# What We've Got

#### Already got a sense of where we're at? Jump ahead to the proposal.

{% page-ref page="what-we-propose.md" %}

## Portal Landing Pages

The landing page bundled in our portal code is also the best "skynet homepage" since it's what users see when they visit [siasky.net](https://siasky.net).

### Pros

* Upload and skylink resolver allow immediate hands-on usage of skynet
* Clean, direct landing view
* Shows ease of integration for developers
* Clean & intuitive implementation of footer and newsletter & social links.

### Cons

* Heavily focuses of files, not skapps. \(Do we need 7 icons to show different common filetypes?\)
* "The decentralized CDN and file sharing platform for devs" ðŸ˜¬ 
* No mention of SkyDB or future of monetization
* Lots of space used to educate about Sia Network, and Skynet takes a position under it!
* Is the heirarchy ideal? Newsletter before educational / faq info? Do we have a Call-to-action?

Additional Links point to the HelpDocs Support, sia.tech, the SDK Docs, and to social platforms.

## HelpDocs Knowledgebase

[This resource](https://support.siasky.net/) acts as an FAQ and Getting Started site for diving deeper into Skynet. It is setup as sections with individual articles arranged as a grid.

### Pros

* Easy backend of editing and changing content \(internally\)
* Powerful search function
* User analytics
* High Readability
* "How did we do?" \(Do folks interact with this?\)

### Cons

* No way to setup "guides," "educational paths/tracks," or much in a linear way.
* Little navigation to aid the user
* Limited customizability
* No integrated way for community to suggest changes
* Not fully maintained, since isolated articles aren't in the "flow" so get forgotten or passed over.
* Little cross-over integration with other resources

HelpDocs seems less well suited for Skynet than it is for [Sia](https://support.sia.tech/). Sia has lots of legacy information that doesn't change quickly, and honestly doesn't need to be _as_ accessible as Skynet will be. You're working with a lower-level infrastructure with lots of folks interacting with the project in various ways, so the built-out docs serve an array of use cases quickly.

## Slate SDK Documentation

The [Skynet SDK docs](https://siasky.net/docs/#introduction) are statically generated documents that serve both as the up-to-date documentation of skynet features, but also as the technical reference for the platform.

### Pros

* Clean, minimal presentation for technical documentation
* Multi-language with good divide between code samples and their explanation.
* Quick navigation at left to give both overview of SDK and quickly review it
* Stays fairly up-to-date with old features
* Self-hosted, simple build setup. Would be nice if it had CI to skynet instead of just Github Pages.
* User contribution accepted! And, for developers, Github makes sense as the place to make those contributions.

### Cons

* Explanation depth is inconsistent. In some places it's beginner friendly, while in other is it highly technical or hardly exists.
* No explanation of the larger ecosystem -- HNS links to old blog post, but context and handholding for some aspects could be useful.
* It's fairly up-to-date, but it doesn't do a good job at showing which SDKs are strong in which areas. 
* Method response sections are also a bit of a mess and don't always match the code run above, which can be confusing.
* No real "best practices," proper getting started guides, beginner explanations of common JS lib issues.
* No real interactive code snippets that could be run in browser, space to integrate processing and best-practices from medium posts, etc.
* No space to engage with community eco-system contributions like SkyId

## Sia Blog Medium Posts

We've got great stuff on the Sia blog.

### Pros

* Reaches outside of site-viewership.
* Attaches personality of team members to content
* Far ranging for audience and content
* Posts well for social, twitter, SEO, etc since it has a date -- no one wants to "go read the latest documentation page update"

### Cons

* It's a bit scattered. It's not always easy to find what you're looking for when you need it.
* Lots of it could act like "further reading" and gets linked in a group of resources, but not often in the context of someone already doing research! For example, Karol's continuous integration article isn't linked in the documentation, where it might be useful.

## Skynet Workshops

This is another resource for beginners getting started. It is an educational resource, it has pros and cons, but it's not totally what we're here for. We need to continue having and producing tutorials/workshops/code examples.
