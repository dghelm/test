This is their on-boarding docs that walk through building a bot from 0 knowledge. I like that it lives separately from their other documentation, builds in a way that does refactoring of code, has git branches for each step and at the end just becomes "choose your own adventure" without just dropping you into technical docs.

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus Docs do a good job at looking at the competition in a cooperative way, while still reinforcing their messaging: [https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/\#comparison-with-other-tools](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/#comparison-with-other-tools)

## Near Docs

Near has a set of nice documentation.

Sherif mentioned that the most common complaint is that you have to split right from the get-go. Apparently making them a linear path is the solution. I think for us, that'll be brining people in with generic information, allowing them to see the ways of interacting with the platform, and then pointing them where they need to go.
