# Outline for General Documentation

## Welcome to Skynet

Here I imagine a high-level overview, hopefully with diagrams that show what skynet is and what it brings to content hosted on the platform. Very marketing/high-level.

### Basics and early pointer outwards to people that just want to "use" skynet

You don't need to know anything about webservers, DNS or blockchain to use the apps that our developers have built! This primer will be enough before linking to a User Guide.

#### You Can Use These Apps!

Skynet Apps Store, skyfeed, dropbox style, maybe the russian screenshot one.

#### What's the appeal of using Skynet apps over others?

Introduce idea of data being your own, immutable skylinks, censorship resistance.

#### What's a portal? Why paid accounts? Do I need one?

Really brief explanation before linking out to the User Guide which will provide walkthrough of making a Sky ID, interacting with another skapp and hopefully then taking that data and accessing it with another skapp.
