# What We Propose

## General Documentation

This would be replace the HelpDocs documentation and provide a basic introduction to Skynet, letting Sia details be handled by Sia docs. It would provide guides for different use cases, allowing users \(subscribers\), portal operators and developers to each have different paths to go along. An initial brainstorm for this can be seen [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ldlr5fQ=/).

Ideally, it would mesh seamlessly with the Skynet Labs webpage so that it never felt like you were entering the "technical zone" but also so that it felt uncluttered once you were there.

This documentation would use GitBook's platform. This allows clean, fast WYSISWG writing that the team can contribute to without being worried about Git. The platform has clean embeds for videos, medium articles, code samples and more. In addition to this, it has a commenting system, a "commit" and "merge" system for work-in-progress documentation similar to Git, and allows Github integration, so we can still publish docs to github, allows user contributions and then merge if we want.

GitBook doesn't look the best with giant paragraphs of text. I'll need to adjust my writing style!
{% endhint %}

In addition to this, getting the team on the Gitlab platform would allow for us to start internal, private documentation of various types. This was highlighted as a problem with the most recent Discord Bot issues. Different folks had isolated knowledge of its history, where it was hosted, what was going on with it, etc. To have the deployment, framework and custom code clearly layed out for whoever is asked to fix or maintain it in two years, is hugely beneficial.

To play with GitBook's functionality and try out internal documentation, I started another gitbook page for the [Discord Bot](https://skynet-labs.gitbook.io/sia-discord-bot/) project.

## Technical Documentation

* Stick with Slate
* It can be a bit more disconnected from website
* Push SDK docs to be more technically precise, while still readable.
* Guide new comers to the general documentation for things like getting started, design patterns, getting going with HNS, etc. Ideally the technical documentation would not have to change as much or be "maintained" outside of improvements of clarity or updates to the SDK.
* Address remaining cons from previous list.

## Skynet & Skynet Labs Homepage

* Highlight platform and technology and impressive stats
* Push "deeper reading" to general documentation
* Teams, careers, ethos, blog, social, etc.
* Link to portal homepage? Incorporate it some other way? Is siasky.net going to be a distinct thing since it'll be taking payments and having to deal with customer support?

## Siasky.net Portal Page

* Questions from above still true.
* adjust branding appropriately.
* Upload, and skylink box still great, but make sure "additional info" or user pricing or general docs are also present somehow.
* We may end up needing to make a distinct "General Docs" for the portal, which GitBook makes easy.

## Medium Articles

* They're great, why change them! We just need to keep an eye on when they're getting dated and pointed to \(like in docs\) so we can adjust them, add notes, remove links to them, etc.
